Crowdfunding Dapp
This is a decentralized application (dapp) that enables users to create and participate in crowdfunding campaigns using blockchain technology.

Getting Started
To get started, you will need to have a compatible Ethereum wallet and a sufficient balance of Ether to interact with the dapp. The dapp can be accessed through a web3-enabled browser such as MetaMask.

Once you have set up your wallet and connected it to the dapp, you can browse existing campaigns or create a new campaign. When creating a new campaign, you will need to specify the funding goal, deadline, and other details about the campaign. Once a campaign is created, other users can contribute Ether to the campaign to help it reach its funding goal.

Features
Create new crowdfunding campaigns with customizable funding goals, deadlines, and other details
Browse and contribute to existing crowdfunding campaigns
View details about a campaign's progress and funding status
Receive refunds if a campaign does not reach its funding goal before the deadline
Automatic payouts to the campaign creator when a campaign reaches its funding goal

Technologies Used
Solidity: the programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain
ThirdWeb: a development framework for building decentralized applications on Ethereum
React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Web3.js: a JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum and other blockchain networks
